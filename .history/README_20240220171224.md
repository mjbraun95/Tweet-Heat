Tweet-Heet: Dynamic Heatmap Visualization of Tweets
Welcome to Tweet-Heet, a cutting-edge project designed to visualize the pulse of the world through tweets. Born out of the HackED-beta competition, Tweet-Heet uses real-time tweet locations to generate interactive heatmaps, revealing fascinating patterns of social media activity across the globe.
What our program does is it crawls through Twitter data and receives live tweets from all over North America. Of all these tweets collected, roughly 10 percent of have location data with it. The program then puts all of these latitude and longitude coordinate points on a map, and generates a heat map where in the highest traffic locations around North America.
